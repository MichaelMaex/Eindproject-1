 Because $\phi$ commutes with $\sigma_k: A^\Z \to A^\Z: (x_i) \mapsto (x_{i+k})$ we can see that $\phi$ maps periodic $(x_i)$ of period $n$ to periodics of period $n$. As the number of periodic $(x_i)$ of period $n$ is finite and $\phi$ is injective, we know that $\phi$ limited to periodic $(x_i)$ is bijective. Futher, the periodic $(x_i)$ are dense in $A^\Z$. So for any $(y_i) \in A^\Z$ there exists a sequence of periodic $a_i = (x_i_j)_j \in A^\Z$ such that $\lim_{i\to \infty} = (y)$. For these there exists inverses $\phi^{-1}(a_i)$. Because $A^\Z$ is compact there is a convergent subsequence of $\phi^{-1}(a_i)$. The limit of this sequence is the inverse of $(y_i)$. Therefore $\phi$ is surjective.
