Let $G$ be a countable residually finite group. As $G$ is countable we can order the elements non-identity elements $g_1, g_2, g_3, \dots$
By the first property of residually finiteness, for every $i=1,2,3, \dots$ there exist a group $G_i$ and a homomorphism $f_i: G \to G_i$ such that $f_i(g_i) \ne 1_G$. Consider the direct products $H_n = \prod_{i = 1}^n G_i$ with the induced homomorphisms $h_i: G \to H_i: g \mapsto (f_1(g), f_2(g), \dots, f_i(g))$. Now we will look at the image of $G$ under these morphisms $\Gamma_i = h_i(G)$.


Notice that $\Gamma_i$ is always finite. We will implicitly identify $\sym(\Gamma_i)$ with $\sym(\card{\Gamma_i})$.
For every $i \in \N$, define $d_i = \card{\Gamma_i}$ and $\Phi_i: G \to \sym(\Gamma_i): g \mapsto (a \mapsto ga)$. We claim that this is a sofic approximation sequence for $G$.

For every $k \in \Gamma_i, g, h \in G$ we can see that $(\Phi_i(g) \circ \Phi_i(h))(k) = ghk = \Phi_i(gh)$. So
\[
\{k \in \Gamma_i \mid (\Phi_i(g) \circ \Phi_i(h))(k) = \Phi_i(gh)\} = \Gamma_i.
\]
Then we can see that for all $g,h \in G$:
$$\lim_{i\to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i} \left|\left\{k \in \Gamma_i| (\Phi_i(g) \circ \Phi_i(h))(k) = \Phi_i(gh)\right\}\right| = 1.$$

For every $g \in G, g\ne 1$ there is an $N \in \N$ such that for every $i > N$, $h_i(G) \ne 1_G$. So it is clear that 
$$\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i} \card{\left\{k \in \Gamma_i \mid \Phi_i(g) = gk \ne k\right\}} = 1.$$
For $g = 1_G$ we find that 
$$\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i} \card{\left\{k \in \Gamma_i \mid \Phi_i(g) = k \ne k\right\}} = 0,$$
which proves the second condition.
