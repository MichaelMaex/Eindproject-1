Let $G$ be a countable residually finite group. As $G$ is countable we can oder the elements non-identity elements $g_1, g_2, g_3, \dots$
By the first property of residually finite there exist finite groups $G_1, G_2, G_3, \dots$ and functions $f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots$ such that $f_i: G \to G_i$ is a homomorphism. Consider the direct products $H_n = \prod_{i = 1}^n G_i$ with the induced homomorphisms $h_i: G \to H_i: g \mapsto (f_1(g), f_2(g), \dots, f_i(g))$. Now we will look at the image of $G$ under these morphisms $\Gamma_i = h_i(G)$.


Notice that $\Gamma_i$ is always finite. We will implicitly identify $\sym(\Gamma_i)$ with $\sym(\card{\Gamma_i})$.
We'll choose $\forall\ i \in \N: d_i = \card{\Gamma_i}$ and $\phi_i: G \to \sym(\Gamma_i): g \mapsto (a \mapsto ga)$. We claim that these maps satisfy the conditions for $G$ to be sofic.

For every $k \in \Gamma_i, g, h \in G$ we can see that $(\phi(g) \circ \phi(h))(k) = ghk = \phi(gh)$. So $\{k \in \Gamma_i \mid (\phi(g) \circ \phi(h))(k) = \phi(gh)\} = \Gamma_i$.
Then we can see that for all $g,h \in G$:
$$\lim_{i\to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i} \left|\left\{k \in \Gamma_i| (\phi(g) \circ \phi(h))(k) = \phi(gh)\right\}\right| = 1.$$

For every $g \in G, g\ne 1$ there is an $N \in \N$ such that for every $i > N$, $h_i(G) \ne e$. So it is clear that 
$$\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i} \card{\left\{k \in \Gamma_i \mid \phi(g) = gk \ne k\right\}} = 1.$$
For $g = e$ we find that 
$$\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i} \card{\left\{k \in \Gamma_i \mid \phi(g) = k \ne k\right\}} = 0,$$
which proves the second condition.
