01/10/2019: Michaël: initial reading, Capraro, Lupini section 2.1, Residually finite, Følner sequence.
02/10/2019: Michaël: found and wrote down proof Folner => Sofic
03/10/2019: Michaël: found and wrote down proof Residually finite => Sofic
06/10/2019: Lucas: Looked at Capraro-Lupini, proved that the definiton given there is equivalent with our definition
07/10/2019: Tomas: initial reading, trying to understand the different definitions of soficity
09/10/2019: Lucas: written down the proof of lemma about bijections needed for proof folner => sofic
13/10/2019: Michaël: added examples of sophic groups:
16/10/2019: everyone: found proof finete abelian groups are amenable and that solvable groups are ameanable
20/10/2019: Mihael: worked out outline for the proof of Kalpanksy's conjecture for finite fieds. (well there are a lot of errors in it).  
27/10/2019: Lucas: read the Weiss paper; looked at the proofs of surjunctivity for the case of the integers and residually finite groups
27/10/2019: Tomas: read Weiss's paper
3/11/2019: read a bit about entropy specifically in Ker-Li but also in a document from Damien Gaboriau i found online. Edited the document and added the proof residually finite => surjunctive.
02/11/2019: Tomas: tried to find and reconstruct proof for Sofic => Surjunctive
03/11/2019: Tomas: tried to understand Weiss's proof for Sofic => Surjunctive
