	abstract = {In mathematics, a Følner sequence for a group is a sequence of sets satisfying a particular condition.  If a group has a Følner sequence with respect to its action on itself, the group is amenable. A more general notion of Følner nets can be defined analogously, and is suited for the study of uncountable groups.  Følner sequences are named for Erling Følner.},
