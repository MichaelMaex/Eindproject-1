\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection*{The Lay of the Land}

This report discusses a conjecture of Kaplansky which states that any group ring $\mathbb{K}[G]$ (defined in \cref{sec:group_rings}) with $\mathbb{K}$ a field is directly finite. That is, the left-invertibility of elements implies their right-invertibility. For general groups and fields, this conjecture so far has remain open. However, it has been resolved for specific cases, in particular the case in which the group $G$ is sofic (defined in \cref{sec:sofic_group}), which means that in some sense $G$ can be approximated well by finite groups. Furthermore, when we talk about finite fields $\mathbb{K}$ we have a positive result for Kaplansky’s conjecture for surjunctive groups (definition in section \ref{sec:surjunctivity}). The class of surjunctive groups is very large and possibly contains all countable groups. Therefore, if we were to have that all countable groups are surjunctive, this would resolve Kaplansky's conjecture for finite fields and countable groups.
The assumption that all countable groups are surjunctive is known as the conjecture of Gottschalk and will be discussed in detail.

\subsection*{Historical Context}

We can trace the origins of the concepts we shall discuss back to the research by John von Neumann throughout the 20th century. First, he introduced the notion of amenable groups (which we shall define in \cref{sec:amenable}) in the context of the Banach-Tarski Paradox. It was meant as a generalisation of commutative groups on the one hand and various versions of finite groups on the other. Secondly, he lay the foundations of the study of so-called ‘cellular automata’. What a cellular automaton is, can be explained the following way. Take a set $A$ (finite or infinite), of which we call the elements ‘states’, and a ‘universe’ of ‘cells’, being a countable group $G$. Now $A^G$ (the set of maps $G \to A$) is the set of configurations. The automaton, then, is a map from $A^G$ to itself, satisfying the property that the state of a specific cell in the image is determined by the initial states of the cells in a bounded neighbourhood of this cell \cite{vonNeumann_1966} .\\
\\
These two concepts may, at first glance, seem completely unrelated. The connection becomes clear, however, when considering the question of surjectivity of these maps on the configuration space. Surjectivity in this context is, intuitively, the property that any configuration can be reached as a result from some other configuration. A configuration that can not be produced because it is not in the image of the (non-surjective) automaton is called a ‘Garden of Eden’. Importantly, such a Garden of Eden always contains a so-called ‘orphan’ which is a cofiguration on a finite subset of the cells which cannot be produced (a finite Garden of Eden, as it were). The Garden of Eden Theorem \cite[preface]{capraro_lupini_2015}
states that a configuration is a Garden of Eden if and only if it contains such an orphan. From this theorem it follows that the injectivity of the automaton implies its surjectivity. Injectivity in this context meaning that no two different configurations ever produce the same one. However, the validity of this theorem has only been proven for amenable groups.
Now, groups $G$ for which it is the case that injectivity of an automaton using any finite alphabet $A$ implies surjectivity of that automaton are the afore mentioned surjunctive groups. This, then, brought research eventually to sofic groups, as this is the largest known class of groups of which all members are known to be surjunctive \cite{ceccherini-silberstein_coornaert_2010}.  

\subsection*{Goal of this Report}

We will mainly focus on the following two concepts: soficity and surjunctivity. First we shall discuss what it means for a group to be sofic. It is a very large class of groups. In fact, there exist no known examples of non-sofic groups \cite[introduction]{weiss_2000}. This will be illustrated by proving soficity for a few large classes of groups. Furthermore, we will discuss its connections to other important concepts and group properties, namely amenability and residually finiteness. Secondly, this report will cover surjunctivity which is related to soficity but will be used to discuss the connection between the conjectures of Kaplansky and Gottschalk. Specifically, it is known that all sofic groups are surjunctive as well.
Finally, we shall discuss Kaplansky's conjecture in the context of finite fields. More precisely, we shall give the details of a proof that the group ring of a surjunctive group and a finite field is directly finite. \Cref{fig:dependency_graph} shows how the different concepts in this report relate to each other.

\section{Group Rings}\label{sec:group_rings} 
% Szabo's comment: Is there a reason you single out these fields here?

The setting of Kaplansky's direct finiteness conjecture is about so-called group rings. These are defined as follows


\begin{definition}\label{def:group_ring}
	Let $\mathbb K$ be a field and $G$ be a group. The \textbf{group ring} $\mathbb K[G]$ is the set of formal linear combinations
    \[
        \sum_{g \in G} \lambda_g g,
    \]
    where $\lambda_g \in \mathbb K$ for all $g \in G$ and only finitely many $\lambda_g$ are nonzero. The operations $+$ and $\cdot$ are defined by
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{g \in G} \lambda_g g + \sum_{g \in G} \mu_g g
        &= \sum_{g \in G} (\lambda_g+\mu_g) g \\
        \left(\sum_{g \in G} \lambda_g g \right) \cdot \left(\sum_{g \in G} \mu_g g \right)
        &= \sum_{g \in G} \left( \sum_{h \in G} \lambda_{h} \mu_{h^{-1}g} \right) g.
        %\sum_{g \in G} \left( \sum_{\substack{g_1, g_2 \in G \\ g_1 g_2 = g}} \lambda_{g_1} \mu_{g_2} \right) g.
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
    Let $\mathbb K$ be a field and $G$ a group. Then $\mathbb K[G]$ is a unital ring.
\end{proposition}
The proof of this theorem is no more than checking the group axioms one by one. For completeness you can find it in appendix \hyperlink{sec:proof_groupring}{A}.

\begin{remark}
	A group ring is in general not commutative. In fact, $\mathbb{K}[G]$ is commutative if and only if $G$ is an abelian group. So we shall have to be careful when dealing with these rings. 
\end{remark}

We can now state Kaplansky's conjecture by the example of the introduction in \cite{elek_szabo_2003}.

\begin{conjecture}[Kaplansky]
	Let $\mathbb K$ be a finite field and $G$ a group. Then $\mathbb K[G]$ is directly finite, i.e. for all $a, b \in \mathbb K[G]$, the equation $ab=1$ implies $ba=1$.
\end{conjecture}

To put it shortly, Kaplansky's conjecture states that for all elements in the group ring, left-invertibility implies right-invertibility. If we work over a finite field $\F$ and $G$ is a finite group, it can quite easily be proven that $\F[G]$ is directly finite.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\F$ be a finite field and $G$ be a finite group. Then $\F[G]$ is directly finite. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $a, b \in \mathbb F[G]$ and suppose $ab=1$. Now consider the map
    \[
        \phi: \mathbb F[G] \to \mathbb F[G]: x \mapsto x a
    \]
    This map is injective. To see this, let $x, y \in \mathbb F[G]$ such that $xa=ya$. Multiply on the right with $b$ and use the associativity to conclude $x=y$.
    Since $\mathbb F[G]$ is a finite set, it follows that $\phi$ must also be surjective. Therefore there exists an $x \in \mathbb F[G]$ such that $x a = 1$. Furthermore, $x = xab = b$. So we have $x = b$.
\end{proof}

Note how the argument hinges on the fact that the map $\phi$ is guaranteed to be surjective by the finiteness of $\mathbb F$ and $G$. In what follows we shall define several ``finiteness'' properties of groups and try to generalise the proof above under weaker assumptions.

\section{Sofic Groups}\label{sec:sofic_group}

\subsection{Definition and Motivation}

In this section we shall introduce the concept of a \emph{sofic group}. A sofic group is a group that is ``well approximated'' by a subgroup of a finite symmetric group. Recall that every finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group
$\sym(n)$, which consists of the permutations of $\{1, \dots, n\}$. We shall also denote the group of permutations of $G$ by $\sym(G)$. This group will often be identified with $\sym(\card G)$.

% Szabo: definitely no. What do you mean by finite permutation groups?

To define this, we shall need a way to measure distances between permutations. It is quite natural to define the distance between two permutation as the fraction of elements on which they differ \cite[subsection 2.1]{capraro_lupini_2015}.

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{Hamming distance} on $\sym(n)$ is defined by
    \[
        d_{\sym(n)}(\sigma, \tau) = \frac 1 n \card{\{k \in \{1, 2, \dots,n\} \mid \sigma(k) \neq \tau(k)\}}, 
    \]
    for every $\sigma, \tau \in \sym(n)$.
\end{definition}

It is easy to show that $d_{\sym(n)}$ is a metric.
We might call a group well-approximated by finite permutation groups if there exists a sequence of ``approximate morphisms''
$(\Phi_i: G \to \sym(d_i))_{i \in \N}$ which mimic the group structure of $G$ increasingly well in $\sym(d_i)$ as $i$ tends to infinity. %akward phrasing?
For that, we first of all want that $d_{\sym(d_i)}(\Phi_i(g) \circ \Phi_i(h), \Phi_i(gh))$ converges to zero, for every $g$ and $h$ in $G$. Additionaly, we want that in the limit these maps have a sort of injectivity property. Therefore, we shall require all elements of $G$ except the identity element to converge out of the kernel of these maps. We add the following condition \footnote{One might ask why we do not require that every $g \neq 0$ converges to some fixed strictly positive number $r(g)$ instead. In fact one can show that if that is the case, one can construct another sequence of maps $\Phi_i' : G \to \sym{d_i'}$ such that $d_{\sym(d_i')}(\id, \Phi_i'(g))$ converges to $1$ for every $g$. A way to do this is outlined in \cite[subsection 2.1, excercise 2.1.8]{capraro_lupini_2015}}
\[
\lim_{i \to \infty} d_{\sym(d_i)}(\id,\Phi(g)) = \begin{cases}  0 & \text{if } g = 1_G \\
                                        1 & \text{otherwise,}
                                        \end{cases}
\]
where $1_G$ denotes the identity element of $G$ and $\id$ is the identity permutation.
\\

We can now state the definiton of a sofic group based on \cite[section 1]{kerr_li_2010}.

\begin{definition}{}\label{def:Sofic}
        Let $G$ be a countable group. We say that $G$ is \textbf{sofic} if there exists a sequence of natural numbers $(d_i)_{i \in \N}$ with associated maps $\Phi_i : G \to \sym(d_i)$ such that for all $g, h \in G$:
        \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
            \item $ \displaystyle \lim_{i \to \infty} d_{\sym(d_i)}(\Phi_i(g) \circ \Phi_i(h), \Phi_i(gh)) = 0$
            \item $ \displaystyle \lim_{i \to \infty} d_{\sym(d_i)}(\id,\Phi(g_i)) = \begin{cases}  0 & \text{if } g = 1_G \\
                                                                                    1 & \text{otherwise,}
                                                                                    \end{cases}$
        \end{enumerate}
        %where $\delta_{e,g}$ is $1$ if $g = e$ and $0$ otherwise. (this is unnecessary as we don't use delta in the definition; that is why szabo wrote '?', not because of the 'sofic approximation'. Yours sincerely, Tomas
    \end{definition}

    We shall call such a family of maps $\left(\Phi_i : G \to \sym(d_i) \right)_{i \in \N}$ 
    a \emph{sofic approximation sequence} for $G$. It is unkown if every group is sofic.

    These two conditions can be easily reformulated in a form more suitable for calculations.

     \begin{lemma}
        Let $G$ be a countable group. Then $G$ is sofic if and only if there exists a sequence of natural numbers $(d_i)_{i \in \N}$ with associated maps $\Phi_i : G \to \sym(d_i)$ such that for all $g, h \in G$:
        \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
            \item $\displaystyle \lim_{i\to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i} \card{\big\{k \in \{1, \dots, d_i\} \mid (\Phi_i(g) \circ \Phi_i(h))(k) = \Phi_i(gh) (k) \big\}} = 1$
            \item $\displaystyle \lim_{i\to \infty} \frac{1}{d_i}  \card{\big\{k \in \{1, \dots, d_i\} \mid \Phi_i(g)(k) = k \big\}} = \begin{cases}  1 & \text{if } g = e \\
                                                                                    0 & \text{otherwise.}
                                                                                    \end{cases}$
        \end{enumerate}

    \end{lemma}


    \subsection{Examples of Sofic Groups}
    The sofic groups are a very large class of groups. 
    In fact there are no known examples of non-sofic groups \cite[Introduction]{weiss_2000}. 
    Here we shall list some groups which are known to be sofic.
    
    
    \begin{example}\label{ex:finite_group_sofic}
    Consider a finite group $G$. Look at the map $\phi: G \to \sym(G): g \mapsto s_g$, where $s_g$ is defined by $s_g(h) = gh$. Clearly, $\phi$ is a homomorphism. Now we can choose $d_i = \card G$ and $\Phi_i = \phi$ for all $i \in \N$. Here we have identified $\sym(G)$ with $\sym(d_i)$. The first condition is satisfied since $\phi$ is a morphism. The second condition follows from the fact that $s_g(h) = gh = h$ if and only if $g$ is the identity.
     Hence every finite group is sofic.
    \end{example}

    % Example: Z

	\begin{example}\label{ex:Z}
	Consider the group $\Z$. Take the sequence of maps $\Phi_{i}: G \to \sym(i): g \mapsto \Phi_{i}(g)$ where $\Phi_{i}(g)$ is defined as the map such that for any $k \in \{1,\dots,i\}$ : $ \Phi_{i}(g)(k) = (g+k) \mod i$. The first condition of soficity is satisfied as for any $i \in \N, g,h \in \Z, k \in \{1,\dots, i\}$ it can be said that 
	\begin{align*}
	(\Phi_{i}(g) \circ \Phi_{i}(h))(k) &= (g+h+k)\mod i \\
	&= \Phi_{i}(g+h)(k)
\end{align*}		
Now for the second condition. It is clear that for any $i \in \N, k \in \{1,\dots, i\}$ : $\Phi_{i}(0)(k) = k$. Now take any $g \neq 0$ and consider $\Phi_{i}(g)$. For any $k \in \{1,\dots,i\}$ it is perfectly possible that $\Phi_{i}(g)(k) = k$. However this is not the case as soon as $i > |g|$. In that case, we have that $|(k+g)-k| < i$, from which it follows that $(k+g) \neq k \mod i$. Thus we have that $(k+g) \neq k \mod i$. Therefore, $\Phi_{i}(g)(k) \neq k$, proving the second condition. 
	\end{example}
    % Example: Direct product of sofic groups is sofic. 

    \begin{example}\label{ex:direct_product_sofic}
        The direct product of two sofic groups is again sofic. Consider two sofic groups $G$ and $H$. Let $(\phi_i: G \to \sym(n_i))_{i \in \N}$ and $(\psi_i: G \to \sym(m_i))_{i \in \N}$ be sofic approximation sequences for $G$ and $H$ respectively. Consider in this example $n_i = \{0, \dots, n_i-1\}$ and $m_i=\{0, \dots, m_i-1\}$. For every $i\in \mathbb N$ we can define $\Psi_i: G \times H \to \sym(n_i \times m_i)$ by $\Psi_i(g,h)(k, l) = (\psi_i(g)(k), \phi_i(h)(l)) \in \sym(n_i \times m_i)$.
        Then we have
        \begin{multline*}
        	\frac{1}{n_i m_i} \card{\big\{(k,l) \in n_i \times m_i \mid (\Phi_i(g,h) \circ \Phi_i(x,y))(k,l) = \Phi_i(gx,hy)(k,l) \big\}} \\
        	= \frac{1}{n_i m_i} \card{\big\{(k,l) \in n_i \times m_i \mid (\phi_i(g) \circ \phi_i(x))(k) = \phi_i(gx)(k) \text{ and } (\psi_i(h) \circ \psi_i(y))(l) = \psi_i(hy)(l)\big\}} \\
        	= \frac{1}{n_i m_i} \card{\big\{ k \in n_i \mid (\phi_i(g) \circ \phi_i(x))(k) = \phi_i(gx)(k)\big\}} \cdot \card{\big\{l \in  m_i \mid (\psi_i(h) \circ \psi_i(y))(l) = \psi_i(hy)(l)\big\}},
        \end{multline*}
        and this converges to $1$ because $(\phi_i)_{i \in \N}$ and $(\psi_i)_{i \in \N}$ are sofic approximation sequences. Similarly,
        \begin{multline*}
        	\frac{1}{n_i m_i} \card{\big\{(k,l) \in n_i \times m_i \mid (\Phi_i(g,h)(k,l) = (k,l) \big\}} \\
        	= \frac{1}{n_i m_i} \card{\big\{(k,l) \in n_i \times m_i \mid \phi_i(g)(k) = k \text{ and } \psi_i(h)(l) = l\big\}} \\
        	= \frac{1}{n_i m_i} \card{\big\{ k \in n_i \mid \phi_i(g)(k) = k \big\}} \cdot \card{\big\{l \in  m_i \mid \psi_i(h)(l) = l\big\}},
        \end{multline*}

        and this converges to $1$ if $(g,h)=(1_G, 1_H)$ and to $0$ otherwise. We thus have constructed a sofic approximation sequence $(\Phi_i: G \times H \to \sym(n_i m_i))_{i \in \mathbb N}$, where we now have identified $\sym(n_i \times m_i)$ with $\sym(n_i m_i)$.


 %        Now consider $\Phi_i : G \times H \to \sym(d_i+e_i)$ for every $i \in \N$, where $\Phi_i(g, h) \in \sym(d_i+e_i)$ is defined by
 %        \[
 %            \Phi_i(g,h)(k) = \begin{cases} \phi_i(g)(k) & \text{if } 1 \leq k \leq d_i \\
 %            \psi_i(h)(k)+d_i & \text{if } d_i + 1 \leq k \leq e_i
 %            \end{cases}.
 %        \]
 %        It is not hard to show that $(\Phi_i)_{i \in \N}$ is a sofic approximation sequence for $G \times H$. % Write out proof
	% Hence finite direct products conserve the soficity property. \todo{Write out proof}
    \end{example}

    In the next sections we shall introduce two classes of groups that are sofic, \emph{amenable groups} and \emph{residually finite groups}. Since it is often easier to check these properties than to work with the definition of soficity, this will allow us to give some more examples. 
    Some notable examples are 
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item countable abelian groups (\cref{thm:countable_abelian_folner})
	    \item countable solvable groups (\cref{thm:countable_solvable_amenable})
	    \item finitely generated free groups (\cref{ex:free_group_residually_finite})
    \end{itemize}
    

    \section{Amenability} \label{sec:amenable}

	\subsection{Definition and Examples}

    Amenable groups are a large class of groups. 
    Many equivalent definitions exist. 
    An extensive study of amenable groups goes beyond the scope of this project. Hence we shall not give multiple definitions and prove equivalence nor shall we provide proofs for every property of amenable groups.

    For our purposes we shall only define amenability for countable groups and take the Følner criterion as definition. In \cite[subsection 4.1]{kerr_li_ergodic_theory} an alternative definition is given, and it is proven that this is equivalent to the Følner criterion, as formulated below.

	    Let $G$ be a countable group.  A \textbf{Følner sequence} of $G$ is a sequence of finite subsets (not necessarily subgroups) $F_1, F_2, \dots \subset G$ such that for all $g \in G$ 
        \[
        \lim_{i\to \infty} \frac{\card{gF_i \triangle F_i}}{\card{F_i}} = 0,
        \]
        where $\triangle$ denotes the symmetric difference. We say that $G$ satisfies the \textbf{Følner criterion} if $G$ has a Følner sequence. We also call such a group \textbf{amenable}.
    \end{definition}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{An illustration of the Følner criterion. The limit means that the gray part will become very small compared to  $F_n$ itself as $n$ gets large.
     More philosophically, this means that  Følner sets remain almost unchanged by multiplication form the left.}
    \label{fig:folner}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:folner} gives a visual intuition for this notion. 
By the following lemma, we can not only exploit this for all the elements $g \in G$ individually, but also for finite subsets $B \subset G$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:folner_finite_subset}
    Let $F_i$ be a Følner sequence. Then for every finite subset $B \subset G$ it holds that  \[
    \lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{\card{BF_i \triangle F_i}}{\card{F_i}} = 0    
    .\] 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_r\} $ and let $(F_n)_n$ be a Følner sequence for $G$.
    Have a look at the following calculation:
    \begin{align*}
	    \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{BF_n \triangle F_n}}{\card{F_n}} &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{BF_n \setminus F_n} + \card{F_n \setminus BF_n}}{\card{F_n}}  \\
									 &= \lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{\card{\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} (b_i F_n \setminus F_n)}+ \card{F_n \setminus BF_n}}{\card{F_n}} \\
									 &\le \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{k} \card{b_i F_n \setminus F_n} +  \card{F_n \setminus b_1 F_n}}{\card{F_n}} \\
                                         &\le \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \frac{\card{b_iF_n \triangle F_n}}{\card{F_n}} = 0,
    \end{align*}
    where we have used the fact that $F_n$ is a Følner sequence.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label{ex:finite_group_folner}
    Every finite group trivially satisfies the Følner condition. Indeed, we can take $F_i = G$ for every $i \in \N$. Note that $gG \triangle G = G \triangle G = \emptyset$. Hence $\card{gF_i\triangle F_i} = 0$ for all $i \in \N$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:integers_folner}
    The group of integers $\Z$ is also amenable. Let $F_i = \{-i, -i+1, \dots, i-1, i\}$ for every $i \in \N$ and let $k$ be an arbitrary integer. Then
    \[
        \frac{\card{(k + F_i) \triangle F_i}}{\card{F_i}}
        = \frac{\card{\{k-i, k-i+1, \dots, k+i-1, k+i\}\triangle \{-i, -i+1, \dots, i-1, i\}}}{2i+1}
        \leq \frac{2|k|}{2i+1},
    \]
    and this converges to zero as $i \to \infty$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Counterexamples are at least as insightful as examples. 
	The free group $F_n = \left<x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \right>, n \ge 2$ is not amenable. % You should first of all properly define what the free group is
	For those not familiar with the free group, a brief introduction is given in appendix \hyperlink{sec:intro_free_group}{B}.
	To prove this we shall have to show that there does not exist a Følner sequence.
	We shall prove that for every non-empty finite subset $B \subset F_n$ it holds that \[
		\card{\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} x_iB \cup x_i^{-1}H} \ge (2n-1) \card{H}
	.\] 
	We can prove this using induction on the size of $B$. 
	\begin{description}
		\item[$\card{B} = 1$:] Then $B = \{g\}$. 
			Hence the left hand side set is $\{x_1g, x_1^{-1}g, x_2g, x_2^{-1}g, \ldots, x_ng, x_n^{-1}g\} $, which has cardinality $2n$. 
		\item[$\card{B} > 1$:] 
			Let $ h \in B$ be an element that has maximum number of letters in reduced form.
			Consider the set $B' = B\setminus \{h\} $. 
			By the induction hypothesis it holds that 
			\[	
				\card{\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} x_i B' \cup x_i^{-1} B'} \ge (2n-1) \card{B'}
			.\] 
			For at least $2n-1$ elements of $\{x_1,x_1^{-1},x_2,x_2^{-1},\ldots, x_n, x_n^{-1}\} $ the words $x_ih$ or  $x_i^{-1}h$ have more letters in reduced form than $h$. Let $\Delta = \{ h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n\} $ be that set.  
			As multiplying by one generator changes the number of letters by $\pm 1$, we see that elements of $\Delta$ are not of the form $x_ih'$ or $x_i^{-1}h'$ for some generator $x_i$ and $h' \in B$. 
			Hence \[
				\card{\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} x_i B \cup x_i^{-1}B}  \ge \card{\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} x_i B' \cup x_i^{-1} B'} + 2n-1
 			.\]
			So \[
				\card{\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} x_i B \cup x_i^{-1}B} \ge (2n-1)\card{B'} + (2n-1) = (2n-1 ) \card{B}
			.\]
			Thus \[
				\card{\{x_1,x_1^{-1}, \ldots, x_n, x_n^{-1}\}B \setminus B} \ge (2n - 2) \card{B}.
			\] This clearly contradicts the condition in \cref{lem:folner_finite_subset}. 
	\end{description}
	We conclude that the free group is not amenable.
\end{example}

\subsection{Properties of Amenable Groups}
We introduced the concept of Amenable groups because they are sofic \cite[prop. 2.3.1]{capraro_lupini_2015}, which will be the first property we proof in the this section. But we first need the following set-theoretic lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:finite_bijections} 
        Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets such that $|A| = |B|$. Given $A' \subset A, B' \subset B$ and a bijection $f': A' \to B'$ there exists a bijection $f: A \to B$ such that $f|_{A'} = f'$. 
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Since $\card A = \card B$ and $\card A' = \card B'$
        \[
        \card{A \setminus A'} = \card A - \card A' = \card B - \card B' = \card{B \setminus B'}.
        \]
        Therefore there exists a bijection $g: A \setminus A' \to B \setminus B'$. Define $f: A  \to B$ by $f(x) = f'(x)$ for all $x \in A'$ and $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x \in A \setminus A'$. Then $f$ is a bijection and $f|_{A'} = f'$.
    \end{proof}

We now state the proof.
\begin{theorem}[{\cite[prop. 2.3.1]{capraro_lupini_2015}}]\label{thm:folner_sofic}
        Every countable amenable group $G$ is sofic.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        \input{proof_folner}
 	\end{proof}

    \begin{proposition}\label{thm:countable_abelian_folner}
        Every countable abelian group is amenable. 
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        \input{proof_abelian_folner}
        % check Szabo's remarks!
    \end{proof}
    As an immediate corollary we get the following well-known result.
    \begin{corollary}
    	Every countable abelian group is sofic.	
    \end{corollary}
 
	The following lemma is a known fact about about amenable groups, that we shall use without proof. 
	The statement is a slight reformulation of {\cite[prop. 4.2.(ii)-(iii)]{kerr_li_ergodic_theory}}, where a proof can be found as well. 
	\begin{lemma}
        \label{lem:amenable_short_exact_sequence}
        Let $A, B, C$ be groups and let $f: A\to B$ be an injective morphism and $g:B\to C$ a surjective morphism such that 
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            A \arrow[r, "f", hook] & B \arrow[r, "g", two heads] & C
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        is an exact sequence i.e. $\im f = \ker g$. Then $A$ and $B$ are amenable if and only if $C$ is amenable.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{corollary}\label{cor:quotient_amenable}
	    Every quotient group of an amenable group is amenable. Every normal subgroup of an amenable group is amenable. 
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{proof}
	    Let $G$ be a amenable group and let $H$ be a quotient group such that $H = \frac{G}{N}$. 
        Consider the following sequence.
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            N \arrow[r, "\iota", hook] & G \arrow[r, "\pi", two heads] & H
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        It is clear that this sequence is exact.
	    Applying the previous lemma shows that $N$ and $H$ are amenable.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proposition}\label{thm:countable_solvable_amenable}
	    Every countable solvable group is amenable. 
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        \input{proof_solvable_amenable}
    \end{proof}

Yet another way to construct amenable groups is given in the follwoing theorem.

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:rising_amenable}
    	Let $G$ be a countable group, for which there exists a set of increasing amenable subgroups $G_1 \subset  G_2 \subset  G_3 \subset  \ldots$ such that $G = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} G_i$. Then $G$ is amenable.  
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    	Let $G = \{g_1, g_2, g_3, \ldots\} $. 
	For every $G_i$ we choose a Følner sequence $(F_{i, n})_n$. We shall use these Følner sequences to construct a Følner sequence for $G$, $\mathcal{F}_n$.
	Let us fix an $n$, and consider the set $H = G_n \cap \{g_1, \ldots, g_n\}$. 
	As $H$ is a finite subset of $G_n$ we can find a Følner set $F_{n, N}$ such that for all $h \in H:$ 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $h \in F_{n, N}$
		\item $\frac{\card{hF_{n,N}\triangle F_{n,N}}}{\card{hF_{n,N}}} < \frac{1}{n} $
	\end{enumerate}
	We define $\mathcal{F}_m = F_{n,N}$.
	As we can do this for every $n$ we can construct $\mathcal{F}_n$ in this way.

	Now we claim that $\mathcal{F}_n$ is a Følner sequence of $G$. 
	To verify this, take $N$ such that $N > i$ and $g_i \in G_N$. For all $m >N$ we see that \[
		\frac{\card{g_i \mathcal{F}_m \triangle \mathcal{F}_m }}{\card{\mathcal{F}_m}} \le \frac{1}{m}
	.\] 
	Hence we find that \[
		\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{g_i \mathcal{F}_n \triangle \mathcal{F}_n }}{\card{\mathcal{F}_n}} = 0
	.\] 
	We conclude that $\mathcal{F}_n$ is a Følner sequence and that  $G$ is amenable. 
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem:fg_ab_amenable}
	    Every finitely generated abelian group is amenable.
    \end{lemma}
     \begin{proof}
	     Let $G = \left<a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_k \right>$ be a finitely generated group. Then \[
		     \phi: \Z^{k} \to G : (n_1, \ldots, n_k) \mapsto a_1^{n_1} a_2^{n_2} \ldots a_k^{n_k} 
	     \]
	     is a surjective groups morphism. Hence $G = \frac{\Z^{k}}{\ker{\phi}}$. 
	     By \cref{cor:quotient_amenable} we see that $G$ is amenable.
	
    \end{proof}
    \begin{remark}
	    \Cref{lem:fg_ab_amenable} and \cref{thm:rising_amenable} give an alternative proof of the fact that every countable group is amenable as every countable group $G = \{g_1, g_2, g_3, \ldots\} $ can be written as the union of $G_n = \left<g_1, g_2, g_3, \ldots, g_n \right>$.
    \end{remark}


Finally we shall list some more properties obout the Følner criterion and Følner sequences. These will be used in subsection \ref{ssec:amenable_surjunctive}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:right_folner_sequence}
	If a group $G$ satisfies the Følner criterion, then there also exists a Følner sequence for the right action of $G$ on itself, 
	i.e. there exists a sequence $F_n$ of finite subsets of $G$ such that 
		for every $g \in G$ the folowing is true: \[
				\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{F_ng \triangle F_n}}{\card{F_n}} = 0
		.\] 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $F_n$ be a Følner sequence for the left action. 
	It is easy to check that $F_n^{-1}$ will be a Følner sequence for the right action. 
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    A result analogous to lemma \ref{lem:folner_finite_subset} holds for a right Følner sequence.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $F_n$, $E_n$ be two (right) Følner sequences for $G$. Then $F_n \cup E_n$ is a (right) Følner sequence for $G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We shall prove it for ordinary (left) Følner sequences as the proof is completely analogous for right Følner sequences.
	The first property is obivously satisfied. 
	Let us have a look at the limit.
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{g(F_n \cup E_n) \triangle (F_n \cup E_n)}}{\card{F_n \cup G_n}} &= 2 \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{(gF_n \cup gE_n)\setminus (F_n \cup E_n)}}{\card{F_n \cup E_n}} \\
														&= 2 \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{F_n \setminus (gF_n \cup g E_n) \cup E_n\setminus (gE_n \cup gF_n) }}{\card{F_n \cup E_n}} \\
														&\le 2 \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{gF_n \setminus F_n} + \card{gE_n \setminus E_n}}{\card{F_n \cup E_n}}\\
														&\le 2 \lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{\card{gF_n \setminus F_n}}{\card{F_n}} + \frac{\card{gE_n \setminus E_n}}{\card{E_n}} \\
														&=  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{gF_n \triangle F_n}}{\card{F_n}} +  \frac{\card{gE_n \triangle E_n}}{\card{E_n}}= 0  
	.\end{align*}
	Hence we see that the claim is valid.
\end{proof}
We find the following corollary. 
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:product_folner_sequence}
	Let $B \subset G$ be a finite subset and $F_n$ be a (left or right) Følner sequence of $G$. Then $BF_n$ and $F_nB$ are again Følner sequences.
\end{corollary}


\section{Residually Finite Groups}

\subsection{Definition and examples}

Another property that implies soficity is the following.

\begin{definition}[{\cite[ch. 1 p. 16]{hall_groups}}] \label{def:res_fin}
	We say that a group $G$ is \textbf{residually finite} if for every $g \in G\setminus\{1_G\}$ there exists a finite group $H$ and a homomorphism $f:G \to H$ such that $f(g) \ne 1_G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Finite groups $G$ are residually finite. Let $g \in G \setminus \{1_G\}$ and consider $\id: G \to G: g \mapsto g$. Obviously $\id(g) \neq 1_G$.
\end{example}

% example: Z

\begin{example}
	The group of integers $\mathbb Z$ is residually finite. Let $k \in \mathbb Z$. Consider the map $f_k: \mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z/(k+1)\mathbb Z: m \mapsto [m]_{k+1}$. Clearly, $f_k$ is a homomorphism and $f_k(k) = [k]_{k+1} \neq 0$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:free_group_residually_finite}
	The free group generated by $n$ elements is residually finite. 
	Consider $F_k = \left<x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_k \right>$.
Let \[
a = x_{i_r}^{\epsilon_r n_r}x_{i_{r-1}}^{\epsilon_{r-1}n_{r-1}}x_{i_{r-2}}^{\epsilon_{r-2}n_{r-2}}x_{i_{r-3}}^{\epsilon_{r-3}n_{r-3}} \ldots x_{i_1}^{\epsilon_1n_1}
,\]
where for every $i$ it holds that $n_i \in \Z_{>0}$ and $\epsilon_i \in \left\{ -1,1 \right\} $, be any non-trivial word in reduced form. 
Our goal is to find a morphism to a finite group that does not map $a$ to 1. 
Define the sequence $(N_i)_{1 \leq i \leq r}$ by $N_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{i} n_j$. 
We shall construct a map from $F_k$ to $\sym(N_r + 1)$, which is the symmetric group on $\{0,1, 2, \ldots, N_{r}\} $.  
By the universal property of free groups, if we want to define a map from $F_k$ to $S_{N_r +1}$ it is sufficient to choose for every $m$ the image of $x_m$.
We shall define it as follows
\[
	x_m \mapsto \ext_{\substack{j \in \{1,\ldots, r\} \\ m = i_j} } \begin{pmatrix} N_{j-1} & N_{j-1} +  1& \ldots & N_{j} -1 & N_{j} \end{pmatrix}^{\epsilon_j}
,\] 
where the brackets denote cycle notation and $\bigcirc$ is the composition of functions indexed in the same way as  $\sum$ or $\prod$.

Using this morphism we can let $F_k$ act on the set $\{0,1,\ldots, N_r\} $. 
We shall determine the position of $0$ after the action of $a$ by keeping track of the position of $0$ after every subsequent  action of  $x_{i_m}^{\epsilon_m n_m}$.

We claim that after acting with $x_{i_{m}}^{\epsilon_{m}n_{m}}x_{i_{m}}^{\epsilon_{m}n_{m}} \ldots x_{i_1}^{\epsilon_1n_1}$ the location of  $0$ is at $N_m$.
We shall prove this claim by induction.
If  $m=0$ we essentially act with the trivial element. So $0$ is at position $0$.
 Suppose that $m \ne 0$ to zero and that the action of $x_{i_{m}}^{\epsilon_{m}n_{m}}x_{i_{m}}^{\epsilon_{m}n_{m}} \ldots x_{i_1}^{\epsilon_1n_1}$ maps $0$ to $N_m$. 
 We can act with  $x_{i_{m+1}}^{\epsilon_{m+1}n_{m+1}}$. 
 If we look at the cycles of $x_{i_{m+1}}$ we can see that $N_m$ (the position of  $0$ ) is in the cycle $(N_m \ldots N_{m+1})^{\epsilon_{m+1}}$. As zero is in this cycle, we can solely focus on what happens within this cycle when dealing with powers of $x_{i_{m+1}}$. 
 Taking the $\epsilon _{m+1} n_{m+1}$-th power means that this becomes the cycle $(N_m \ldots N_{m} + n_{m+1})^{n_{m+1}} = (N_{m+1} N_{m+1}-1 \ldots N_m + 1 N_m)$. 
So we see that $0$ now gets mapped to $N_m$, which proves our claim.

As the action of  $a$ maps $0$ to $N_r \ne 0$, we see that the image of  $a$ in  $S_n$ cannot be trivial. 
We conclude that $F_k$ is residually finite.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{Illustration of the action in the case of $F_2 = \left<a,b \right>$}
	\label{fig:}
\end{figure}

\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Not every countable group is residually finite. One example we found is $\Q, +$.
	We can see this as the image of every morphism from $\Q, +$ to a finite group must be trivial. 
	\begin{proof}
		Suppose that $f:\Q \to H$ is a group morphism, where $H$ is a finite group. 
		As $H$ is finite, it has finite oder, $n$.
		Take any $q \in \Q$. 
		We know that  \[
			f(q) = f\left(n\cdot \frac{q}{n}\right) = f\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)^{n} = 1_H
		.\]

    \section{Surjunctivity}\label{sec:surjunctivity}

    First we recall a well-known concept in group theory.

    \begin{definition} % van wikipedia gehaald
	    Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a set. Then $\alpha: G \times X \to X: (g,x) \mapsto \alpha_g(x)$ is called a \textbf{right (group)action} of $G$ on $X$ if
        \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item $\forall x \in X: \alpha_{1_G}(x) = x$
            \item $\forall g,h \in G, x\in X: \alpha_{hg}(x) = \alpha_g(\alpha_h(x))$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}

    In this section we shall encounter the set of all maps from $G$ to a finite set $A$. This set will be denoted by $A^G$. We shall consider this set as a topological space, the topology on $A^G$ being the product topology, where $A$ carries the discrete topology. We shall use ``sequence''-style notation and denote the elements of $A^G$ by $(x_g)_{g \in G}$ or $(x_g)_g$. In what follows, we shall further use the fact that $A^G$ is a compact Hausdorff space.

    \begin{definition}
	    Let $G$ be a countable group and $A$ a finite set. Then the \textbf{right shift} $\sigma$ of $G$ on $A^G$ is defined by
        \[
        \sigma: G \times A^G \to A^G: \left(g, (x_{h})_{h \in G} \right) \mapsto \sigma_g((x_{h})_{h \in G}) = \left( x_{hg} \right)_{h \in G}.
        \]
        %where $\sigma_g$ is defined by $\sigma_g\left( (x_{h})_{h \in G} \right) = \left( x_{hg} \right)_{h \in G}$.

    \end{definition}

    One can see that the right shift $\sigma$ is a right action of $G$ on $A^G$. We say that a map $\phi: A^G \to A^G$ \emph{commutes with the right shift} if $\sigma_g \circ \phi = \phi \circ \sigma_g$ for every $g \in G$.
    
    \begin{definition}
	    Let $G$ be a countable group. The group $G$ is called \textbf{surjunctive} if for any finite set $A$ and every injective and continuous map $\phi: A^{G}\to A^{G}$ that commutes with the right shift $\sigma$ of $G$ on $A^G$ is also surjective \cite[section 1]{weiss_2000} .
	    \footnote{There is an alternative way to define this in terms of the \emph{left shift} $\tau$ defined by $\tau_g(h)= g^{-1}h$. This approach is completely equivalent and is followed by \cite[paragraph 2.13.5 - 2.13.7]{capraro_lupini_2015}.}
    \end{definition}

Since there are no known examples of countable groups which are not surjunctive, the following conjecture seems quite natural \cite[introduction]{weiss_2000}.

    \begin{conjecture}[Gottschalk] \label{conj:gottschalk}
        Every countable group is surjunctive  .
    \end{conjecture}

    It can be proven that every sofic group is surjunctive. However, the proof is not easy. For that reason we shall prove it first for the special case of residually finite groups. We shall need the following definition
\begin{definition}
    Let $G$ be a countable group and $A$ a finite set. Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of finite index. Then the set of \textbf{$H$-periodic points} is the following subset of $A^G$.
        \[
        P_H = \{ (x_g)_{g \in G} \in A^G  \mid \forall h \in H: \sigma_h((x_g)_g) = (x_g)_g\}
        \]
\end{definition}

% Notice that this means that any $\omega \in P_H$ can be factored into the natural quotient map $i: G \to \frac{G}{H}$ and a function  $f: \frac{G}{H} \to A$ such that $\omega = f \circ i$.
% As we require $H$ to be normal and of finite index, we get that $\frac{G}{H}$ is a finite set. 
% So $f$ is a function from and to finite sets.
% There are only a finite number of such functions. 
% Hence $P_H$ is a finite set.

Since $H$ is of finite index, there exist elements $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_n$ such that $G = \bigcup_{i=1}^n g_i H$. It is then sufficient to specify $x_{g_1}, x_{g_2}, \dots, x_{g_n}$ to uniquely determine an element $(x_g)_{g \in G}$ of $P_H$. Indeed, any $g \in G$ can be written as $g = g_ih$ for some $i$, and then we have $x_g = x_{g_ih} = x_{g_i}$. Thus $P_H$ is finite since $A$ has only finitely many elements.

\begin{remark}
We can make this very explicit for the group $\Z$. The (normal) subgroups of finite index of $\Z$ are precisely the groups $n\Z$, for $n \in \Z$. A $n\Z$-periodic point $(x_k)_{k \in \Z}$ can be specified by giving the values of $x_k$ for $k=0, 1, \dots, k-1$. In this case, the sequence 
$(x_k)_{k \in \Z}$ is a periodic sequence with period $n$. This motivates the name ``periodic point''.
\end{remark}

A key lemma we shall further need in our proof of theorem \ref{thm:res_fin_surjunctive} is the following:

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:h-periodic_points}
    % The $H$-periodic points are dense in $A^G$, where $A$ is a finite set and $G$ is a residually finite countable group.
	    %\todo{Szabo: Be more precise. In light of your previous remark you obviously don't mean what you write. You claim denseness for the set of all points which are periodic w.r.t. some H, or, the union of the H-periodic points over ALL H.}
    
Let $G$ be a countable group and $A$ a finite set. Then the set of all periodic points (with respect to all normal subgroups of finite index)
    \[
    \bigcup_{\substack{ H \triangleleft G \\ [G : H] < \infty}} P_H
    \]
is dense in $A^G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
% \input{periodic_points_dense_old}
\input{periodic_points_dense}
\end{proof}

Now we can quite easily prove the following result. We follow the proof of Weiss \cite[Theorem 1.3]{weiss_2000} here.
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:res_fin_surjunctive}
    Every residually finite group is surjunctive.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \input{proof_residually_finite_surjunctive}

\section{Surjunctivity of Amenable and Sofic Groups}

In subsection \ref{ssec:amenable_surjunctive} we present a proof of the fact that amenable groups are surjunctive. In the literature, it is common to do this using the concept of entropy (as in \cite[section 4]{kerr_li_2010} or \cite[subsection 2.13]{capraro_lupini_2015}), or using graph theory (as in \cite[section 3]{weiss_2000}). However, we came up with an alternative approach, independent of the literature, and will prove this well-known result directly from our definitions. We were unable to find a proof in the literature that follows the same approach, but it is important to point out that our proof and the aforementioned proofs have many conceptual similarities. 

Alas, we were unable to generalise these techniques to show that sofic groups are surjunctive. In subsection \ref{ssec:sofic_surjunctive}, we show how one can obtain the surjunctivity result for sofic groups using the concept of entropy loosely following \cite[paragraph 2.13.6 - 2.13.7]{capraro_lupini_2015}.


\subsection{Amenable Groups are Surjunctive} \label{ssec:amenable_surjunctive}
Throughout the following section $G$ will be a fixed countable, amenable group, $A$ a fixed finite set and $\phi: A^{G} \to A^{G}$ a fixed continuous, injective function that commutes with the right shift. 
We shall also often denote a fixed element of $A$ with $0$.
To keep the final proof clean, we first present several intermediate results of which the following one is the most important.
\begin{lemma}
	There exists a finite subset $\Gamma \subset G$ such that the value of $\phi((x_g)_{g \in G})(1_G)$ is only dependent on the values of $x_\gamma$ where  $\gamma \in \Gamma$, 
	i.e. if for some  $(x_g)_{g \in G}, (y_g)_{g \in G} \in A^{G}$ it holds that $x_\gamma = y_\gamma$ for all $\gamma \in \Gamma$, then $\phi((x_g)_{g \in G})(1_G) = \phi((y_g)_g)(1_G)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Choose any $a \in A$. As $\phi$ is continuous we know that \[
	U_a = \phi^{-1}\left( \prod_{g\in G} \begin{cases}
			\{a\} & g = 1_G\\
			A & g \ne 1_G
	\end{cases} \right)
\]
	is open. Hence we can choose basis opens $U_{i, a}$ for some set of indices $i \in I$ such that  \[
		U_a= \bigcup_{i \in I} U_{i,a}
	.\] 
	Notice that $\bigcup_{a \in A} U_a = A^{G}$ is a disjoint union. 
	Hence $\bigcup_{a \in A, i \in I} U_{i, a} = A^{G}$. 
	As $A^{G}$ is compact, we see that there must exist a finite subset of indices $K$ such that \[
		A^{G} = \bigcup_{(i, a) \in K} U_{i, a}
	.\] 
	Every one of these basis opens is of the form \[
	U_{i,a} = \prod_{g \in G} \begin{cases}
		V_{i,a,g} & g \in \Gamma_{i,a}\\
		A & g \not\in \Gamma_{i,a}
	\end{cases}
	,\]
	for some open sets $V_{i,a,g} \subset A$ and finite subsets $\Gamma_{i,a} \subset G$. 

	We now claim that $\Gamma = \bigcup_{(i,a) \in K} \Gamma_{i,a}$ is, in fact, the set we are looking for. 
	Obviously, $\Gamma$ is finite. 
	Furthermore, suppose that $(x_g)_{g\in G} \in A^{G}$ and $(y_g)_{g \in G} \in A^{G}$ agree on $\Gamma$,
	meaning that for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$ it holds that  $x_\gamma = y_\gamma$.
	Then, we know that for some  $(i, a) \in K$ the point $(x_g)_g \in U_{i,a}$. 
	In particular, we see that $x_\gamma = y_\gamma$ for every $\gamma \in \Gamma_{i,a}$. 
	Thus $(y_g)_{g \in G} \in U_{i, a}$. 
	Hence  $(x_g)_{g \in G} , (y_g)_{g \in G}$ are elements of $U_a$. 
	Therefore  $\phi((x_g)_{g \in G})(1_G) = a = \phi((y_g)_{g \in G})(1_G) $.
	We conclude that $\Gamma$ is indeed the desired set.
\end{proof}
From this point on, we will also fix $\Gamma$. 

\begin{corollary}
	For any $k \in G$ the value of $\phi((x_g)_{g \in G})(k)$ is only dependent on the values of $x_{k\gamma}$ where $\gamma \in \Gamma$.
\end{corollary}	
\begin{proof}
	As $\phi$ commutes with the right shift  $\sigma_k$, we know that $\sigma_k \circ \phi = \phi \circ \sigma_k$. Applying the previous lemma immediately gives the required result.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:differ_in_image}
	If $(x_g)_{g \in G}, (y_g)_{g\in G} \in A^{G}$ only differ on a set $H \subset G$, i.e. $\forall g \not\in H:x_g = y_g$,
	then  $\phi((x_g)_{g \in G})$ and $\phi((y_g)_{g \in G})$ will only differ on $H\Gamma^{-1}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Take $g \not\in H\Gamma^{-1}$. Then $\phi((x_h)_{h \in G})(g)$ and $\phi((x_h)_{h\in G})(g)$ will only depend on  $\{x_{g\gamma}\mid \gamma \in \Gamma\}$ and $\{y_{g\gamma}\mid \gamma \in \Gamma\}$ respectively. But  $g\Gamma \cap H = \emptyset$. Hence $x_{g\gamma} = y_{g\gamma}$ for all $\gamma \in \Gamma$. By the previous corollary we see that $\phi((x_h)_{h \in G})(g) = \phi((y_h)_{h \in G})(g)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	We say that $(x_g)_{g \in G} \in A^{G}$ has support $H \subset G$, if $x_g = 0$ for all $g \not\in H$.
\end{definition}
Let $A_H$ be the set of all element of  $A^{G}$ with support $H$. We can implicitly identify $A_H$ with $A^{H}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:injective_restriction}
	Let $H$ be any finite subset of $G$. Consider the function  \[
		\psi:A_H \to A ^{H\Gamma^{-1}}: (x_g)_{g \in G} \mapsto \left(h \mapsto \phi((x_g)_{g \in G})(h)\right)
	.\]  
	This function is an injection. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $x= (x_g)_{g \in G}$ and $ y = (y_g)_{g \in G} \in A^{H}$ have the same image under $\psi$. As $x, y$ can only differ on $ H$, their images under $\phi$ cannot differ in $G\setminus H\Gamma^{-1}$ (see \cref{cor:differ_in_image}). Because they also have the same image under $\psi$, we know that $\phi(x)$ and $\phi(y)$ must also agree on $H\Gamma^{-1}$. Hence $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$. By the injectivity of $\phi$ we find that $x = y$.
\end{proof}

At this point we are almost ready to prove that $G$ is surjunctive, i.e.\ $\phi$ is surjective. 
In order to show this, we shall show that for any finite subset $B\subset G$ and a map $f:B \to A$ we can find an $x \in A^{G}$ such that $\phi\left(x \right) |_B  = f$. Then we can finish the proof by showing that the image of $\phi$ is dense and using compactness.


\bigskip

For now, we shall fix the set $B \subset G$ and the map $f:B \to A$ and introduce the notion of a copy of $B$. \footnote{This term is not standard. However, it will simplify the discussion in our following proofs.}
\begin{definition}
	A set  $A \subset  G$ is a copy of $B$ if and only if there exists an $s \in G$ such that $A = B\cdot s$.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:copies_of_B}
	Let $F$ be any finite subset of $G$. There exists a subset $F' \subset F$ such that for any two  $s, t \in F'$ where $s\ne t$, it holds that $B\cdot s$ and  $B\cdot t$ are disjoint and $\card{F'} \ge \frac{\card{F}}{\card{B}^2} $
\end{lemma}
In other words, the set  $BF$ contains at least $\frac{\card{F}}{\card{B^2}}$ disjoint copies of $B$.

\begin{proof}
	 We shall prove this using strong induction on $\card{F}$. The case where $F = \emptyset$ is trivial. 
	\begin{description}
		\item{Case $1 \le \card F \le \card{B}^2$:} 
		Let  $f \in F$ be an arbitrary element of $F$. 
		The set $\{f\} $ has 1 element which is atleast $\frac{\card F}{\card B^2} \le 1$.
	\item{Case $\card F > \card{B}^2$ :}
		Take any  $f \in F$. Suppose that for some  $s \in G$,  $Bf$ and  $Bs$ are not disjoint. 
		Hence there exists $a,b \in B$ such that $af = bs$. 
		Thus $s = b^{-1}af$. So $s \in fB^{-1}B$. Notice that $\card{fB^{-1}B}\le \card{B}^2$.
		This means that for any $f' \in F \setminus fB^{-1}B$, $Bf$ and $Bf'$ will be disjoint. 
		Notice that $\card F > \card{F \setminus f B^{-1}B} \ge \card F - \card{B}^2 $.

		Applying the induction hypothesis shows that there exists a $F'\subset  \left( F\setminus fB^{-1}B \right) $ such that  for all  $s, t \in F'$, $Bs$ and $Bf$ are disjoint, 
		and that \[\card {F'}  \ge \frac{\card{F \setminus fB^{-1}B }}{\card{B}^2}.\]
		Furthermore, for every $f' \in F\setminus fB^{-1}B$, $Bf$ and  $Bf'$ will be disjoint. 
		Thus, for every  $ s, t \in \{ f\} \cup F'\} $,  $Bs$ and $Bt$ will be disjoint.
		Then we have that \[
			\card{\{f\} \cup F'}  = 1 + \card{F' } \ge 1 + \frac{\card{F \setminus fB^{-1}B}}{\card B^2} \ge \frac{\card{F}}{\card{B}^2}
		.\] 
		We conclude that $\{f\} \cup  F'$ is the desired set. 
	\end{description}
\end{proof}


We are finally set up to prove that all amenable groups are surjunctive.
\begin{theorem}
	Let $G$ be a countable, amenable group and  $A$ be finite set, where we shall choose one element and denote it with $0$. Let  $\phi: A^{G} \to A^{G}$ be a injective, continuous map that commutes with the right shift. Then $\phi$ is surjective.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let us fix a finite subset $B \subset G$ and a map $f:B\to A$. 
	Suppose that there does not exists an $x \in A^{G}$ such that $\phi(x)|_B = f$.
	Notice that this means that for any copy of $B$, say  $B\cdot s$, the image of $\phi$ does not contain a function  $\phi(x): G \to A$ such that when restrited to  $B\cdot s$ it becomes $f': B\cdot s \to A: x \mapsto f\left( x s^{-1} \right) $, since applying the right shift $\sigma_{s^{-1}}$ then gives $\phi(\sigma_{s^{-1}} x) |_{B} = f$.

	Let $F_n$ be a right Følner sequence of $G$. By \cref{cor:product_folner_sequence} we know that $BF_n$ is a right Følner sequence as well. 

	Fix  $n$ for a moment. By \cref{lem:injective_restriction} the function \[
		\psi: A^{BF_n} \to A^{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}: x \mapsto (g \mapsto \phi(x)(g))
	.\] 
	is injective.
	\Cref{lem:copies_of_B} states that we can choose  $ \left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil $ disjoint copies of $B$ in $BF_n\Gamma$. 
	We know that for every such copy of $B$ the number of possible values at the coordinates of this copy is atmost  $\card{A}^{\card{B}} -1$ by our assumption at the start of this proof.
	Hence there exists a set $\mathcal{A} \subset A^{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}$ of cardinality \[
		\card{\mathcal{A}} = \card{A}^{\card{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}- \card{B}\left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil } \cdot (\card{A}^{B} -1)^{\left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil }
\]
such that $\im\psi \subset \mathcal{A}$. 
As $\psi$ is injective it follows that $\card{A^{BF_n}} \le \card{\mathcal{A}}$. Hence
\[
	\card{A}^{\card{BF_n}} \le 
	\card{A}^{\card{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}- \card{B}\left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil } \cdot (\card{A}^{B} -1)^{\left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil }
.\]
By taking the natural logarithm of both sides we obtain
\[
	\card{BF_n}\ln(\card{A}) \le \card{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}} \ln(\card{A}) - \left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil \left( \ln(\card{A}^{\card{B}}) - \ln(\card{A}^{\card{B}} -1) \right)   
.\]
By dividing both sides by $\card{BF_n}$ we see 
\[
	\ln(\card{A}) \le \frac{\card{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{BF_n}} \ln(\card{A}) - \frac{1}{\card{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}}\left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil \left( \ln(\card{A}^{\card{B}}) - \ln(\card{A}^{\card{B}} -1) \right)   
.\]
\Cref{lem:folner_finite_subset} shows that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\card{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{BF_n}} = 1$. 
So we know as well that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\card{BF_n\Gamma^{-1}}} \left\lceil \frac{\card{F_n\Gamma^{-1}}}{\card{B}^2} \right\rceil \ge \frac{1}{\card{B}^3} $. 
Therefore, \[
	\ln(\card{A}) \le \ln(\card{A}) - \frac{1}{\card{B}^3} \left(\ln(\card{A}^{\card{B}}) - \ln(\card{A}^{B} - 1) \right)
,\]
which yields a contradiction. 
So our initial assumption is false. 

\bigskip

This means that there exists a $x \in A^{G}$ such that $\phi(x)|_B = f$.
Remember that this is true for every finite subset $B$. 

We claim that this is enough to show that the image of $\phi$ is dense in $A^{G}$. 
Take any $(x_g)_g \in A^{G}$ and a basis open $U$ around $(x_g)_g$. Then $U$ must be of the form  \[
U = \prod_{g \in G} \begin{cases}
	\{x_g\} & \text{if } g \in B\\
	A & \text{if } g \not\in B
\end{cases}
.\] 
Then we can define can take  $f:B\to A: g \to (x_{g})_g$. 
As we have just proven, we can find some $y \in G$ such that  $\phi(y)|_B = f$. Hence $\phi(y) \in U$. So the image of $\phi$ is dense. 
As a map on compact spaces maps closed sets to closed sets we see that the image of $\phi$ must be $A^{G}$. 
We conclude that $\phi$ is surjective!


\end{proof}


\subsection{Sofic Groups, Entropy and Surjunctive Groups}\label{ssec:sofic_surjunctive}

In order to prove that sofic groups are always surjunctive we define sofic entropy. The definition we present is a particular case of the more general definition formulated in \cite[paragraph 2.13.6]{capraro_lupini_2015} and is equivalent to the one given in \cite[definition 4.2]{kerr_li_2010}. 

\begin{definition}

A subshift $X \subset A^G$ with $A$ a finite set and $G := \{g_0 = 1_G, g_1, g_2, ...\}$ any countable group is a closed subset which is invariant under the shift $\sigma$.\\
\\
Suppose now that $G$ is sofic and $\Sigma := (\Phi_i: G \to \sym(d_i))_{i \in \N}$ is a sofic approximation sequence. Take a subshift $X$ and a finite subset $F \subset G$. For any $\delta > 0$ and $n \in \N$ we define the set 
		\[
		H_n (\delta) := \{(a_i)_{0 \leq i \leq n-1} \in A^n \mid 
						\exists (x_i)_{0 \leq i \leq n-1} \in X_n : 
						\forall g \in F: d((a_{\Phi^{-1}_n(g)(i)})_i,(x_{g g_i })_i) < \delta \}
		\]
		% \[
		% H_n (\delta) := \{(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1}) \in A^n \mid
		% 				\exists (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}) \in X_n : 
		% 				\forall g \in F: d_{S_n}((a_{\Phi^{-1}_n(g)(i)})_i,(x_{g g_i})_i) < \delta \}
		% \]
		where by $X_n \subset A^n$ we mean the sequences in $X$ restricted to $\{1_G, g_1, g_2, ..., g_{n-1}\}$ (and we identify $x_{g_i}$ with $x_i$ for all $0 \leq i \leq n-1$). By the distance $d((x_i)_i, (y_i)_i)$ between two sequences $(x_i)_{0 \leq i \leq n-1}$ and $(y_i)_{0 \leq i \leq n-1}$ is meant the number of different components relative to their length:
		\[
		d((x_i)_i, (y_i)_i) = \frac{1}{n} |\{i \in \{0, ..., n-1\}|x_i \neq y_i\}|
		\]
				

		Now we define entropy as 
		\[
		h_\Sigma(X) := \inf_{\delta>0} \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \log |H_n(\delta)|
		\]
\end{definition}


We shall use the following intermediate result, for which a sketch of the proof is provided. For the complete proof, we refer to either \cite[paragraph 2.13.7]{capraro_lupini_2015} or \cite[theorem 4.12]{kerr_li_2010}.

\begin{lemma}
For $X \subset A^G$ a subshift we have that 
		\[
		h_\Sigma(X) = \log |A| \Leftrightarrow X = A^G
		\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For the implication $X = A^G \Rightarrow h_\Sigma(X) = \log |A|$: assume that $X = A^G$. Now it is quite clear that for any $n \in \N$ and $\delta > 0$: $|H_n(\delta)| = |A|^n$. Indeed, for any $(a_i)_i \in A^n$ we can find a sequence $(x_i)_i \in X^n$ such that $\forall g \in F: d_{S_n}((a_{\Phi^{-1}_n(g)(i)})_i,(x_{g g_i })_i) < \delta$. Namely  $(a_i)_i$ itself. Therefore $h_\Sigma(X) = \log |A|$.\\
\\
For the implication $h_\Sigma(X) = \log |A| \Rightarrow X = A^G$: assume that $X \varsubsetneq A^G$. It is possible that a certain element of $A$ is never a component in one of the elements of $X$. However, in that case we have that $h_\Sigma(X) \leq \log (|A|-1) $ and thus $h_\Sigma(X) < \log |A|$. Assume, therefore, that every element of $A$ is a component in at least one of the elements of $X$. Now there must exist some finite $F \subset G$ such that $X_F \varsubsetneq A^G$. It can then be shown that, using this $F$, we have that
		\[
		h_\Sigma(X) \leq \log |A| - \frac{1}{|F|^2} \log \left(\frac{|A|^{|F|}}{|A|^{|F|} - 1}\right) < \log |A|
		\]
which proves the implication by contraposition. 
\end{proof}

Now we can prove the surjunctivity of sofic groups.

\begin{theorem}
Any sofic group G is surjunctive.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\input{proof_sofic_surjunctive}
\end{proof}

	\section{Kaplansky's Direct Finiteness Condition for Finite Fields}
	Let us restate the statement of Kaplansky's direct finiteness condition.
	\begin{definition}
		Let $\mathbb K$ be a field and $G$ be a group. The group ring $\mathbb K[G]$ is called \textbf{directly finite} if every  $a \in K[G]$, that is left invertible, is right invertible as well. 
		
	\end{definition}
	Kaplansky conjectured that all group rings are directly finite and Weiss showed that this is true for all sofic groups \cite[section 3, section 4]{weiss_2000}. 
	In the case where $\mathbb K$ is a finite field, Weiss did this by first proving the surjunctivity of sofic groups.
	He finished the argument by proving that the group rings of finite fields and surjunctive groups are directly finite.  

	In this section we shall give the details of a proof of that last step. 
	i.e we shall prove the following theorem. 
	\begin{theorem}\label{thm:gottschalk_kaplansky}
		Let $\F$ be a finite field and $G$ be a surjunctive group. Then $\F[G]$ is directly finite. 
	\end{theorem}
	%It looks like we will need to use the surjuctivity on $\F^{G}$. Hence we need some statement that relates $\F^{G}$ to $\F[G]$.
	To exploit the surjunctivity property of $G$, we shall need to relate $\mathbb F^G$ to the group ring $\mathbb F[G]$. There is in fact a very nice connection that can be made for any field $\mathbb K$.
	For finite groups, one can very naturally identify $\mathbb K^G$ with the group ring $\mathbb K[G]$. Indeed, with every element $(x_g)_{g \in G}$ in $\mathbb K^G$, there corresponds an element $\sum_{g \in G} x_g g$ in $\mathbb K[G]$, where $G$ being finite guarantees that this is a finite linear combination. For infinite groups, we cannot identify these two sets, but we can consider $\mathbb{K}[G]$ as a subset of $\mathbb K^G$. In this case, $\mathbb K^G$ is not a ring but we can make it into a module over $\mathbb K[G]$. We can do this in a very natural way, extending the multiplication as defined in \cref{def:group_ring}. Here, one can think of the elements of $\mathbb K^G$ as (possibly infinite) formal sums $\sum_{g \in G} x_g g$ in $\mathbb K[G]$.

	\begin{lemma}
		For a group $G$ and field $\mathbb K$ we can consider $\mathbb{K}^{G}$ as a left $\mathbb{K}[G]$-module, with pointwise addition and multiplication defined as
		\begin{align*}
			\cdot : (\mathbb{K}[G] , \mathbb{K}^{G}) &\longrightarrow \mathbb{K}^{G} \\
		\left( \sum_{g \in G} a_g g,  (x_g)_{g \in G}\right)  &\longmapsto \left( \sum_{h \in G} a_h x_{h^{-1}g} \right)_{g \in G}
	.\end{align*} 
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		The proof is given in appendix \hyperlink{sec:module}{C}.
	\end{proof}
    %     \begin{remark}
    %     The way $\F^{G}$ is defined as a $\F[G]$-module is not completely abitrary. It should be easy to see that  $\F^{G}$ can be represented as formal sums $\sum_{g \in G} x_g g$, just like $\F[G]$, but where we now allow infinite sums. 
    %     The definition of the multiplication between $\F[G]$ and  $\F^{G}$ agrees with the obvious multiplication with $\F^{G}$ represented as above. 
    % \end{remark}
    
	We are now ready to give a proof of \cref{thm:gottschalk_kaplansky}.
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\F$ be a finite field and $G$ be a surjunctive group. 
		Let $a = \sum_{g \in G} a_g g \in \F[G]$ be a left invertible element with left inverse $b$, i.e.  $b a = 1$. 
		Consider the map $\phi: \F^{G} \to \F^{G}: x \mapsto a\cdot x$. Notice that this map 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item is injective. Suppose that $\phi(x) = \phi(y)$. Then $a\cdot x = a\cdot y$. So $ba\cdot x  = x$ and $ba \cdot y = 1\cdot y = y$. Hence $x = y$.
			\item commutes with the bernoulli shift  $\sigma_k$. 
				 \[
					 \sigma_k \phi(x) 
					 = \sigma_k\left( \sum_{h \in G} a_h x_{h^{-1}g} \right)_{g \in G} 
					 = \left( \sum_{h \in G} a_h x_{h^{-1}gk} \right)_{g \in G} 
					 = \left( \sum_{h \in G}a_h h \right) \cdot (x_{gk})_{g \in G} = \phi(\sigma_k(x)) 
				\]
			\item is continuous. 
			One can easily check that the set $\left\{ U_{h, t} \right\}$, where \[
			U_{h,t}:= \prod_{g \in G} \begin{cases}
				\F & h \ne g\\
				\{t\}& h = g
			\end{cases}
			.\] 
			is a subbasis of $\F^{G}$. 
			Hence, to prove that $\phi$ is continuous it is sufficient to check that $\phi^{-1}(U_{h, t})$ is open for every $h \in G, t\in \F$.
			Notice that an element $(x_g)_{g \in G} \in \F^{G}$ is in $\phi^{-1}(U_{h,t})$ if and only if $\sum_{k \in G} a_k x_{k^{-1}h} = t$. 
			Remember that $a_k$ is nonzero only for $k \in X$, where $X$ is some finite subset of $G$. 	
			So $\phi^{-1}(U_{h, t})$ is closed under addition with an element of  \[
			\prod_{g \in G} \begin{cases}
				\F & hg^{-1}  \not\in X\\
				\{0\} & hg^{-1} \in X 
			\end{cases}
			.\] 
			Let  $(x_g) \in \phi^{-1}(U_{g,t})$. We see that  \[
				(x_g) \in \prod_{g \in G} \begin{cases}
					\F & hg^{-1} \not\in X\\
					\{x_g\} & hg^{-1} \in X
				\end{cases}
				\subset \phi^{-1}(U_{h, t})
			.\] 
			So $\phi^{-1}(U_{h,t})$ is open. Hence $\phi$ is continuous.			
		\end{itemize}
		By the surjunctivity of $G$, we find that $\phi$ is surjective as well. In particular, this means that there exists a $y = (y_g)_{g \in G}$ such that $\phi(y) = (\delta_{g, 1})_{g \in G}$, where $\delta$ is the kronecker delta.
		By multiplying with $b$ on the left we find that \[
			 y = ba\cdot y = b\cdot (\delta_{g, 1})_{g \in G} = \left( \sum_{h \in G} b_{h} \delta_{h^{-1}g, 1} \right)_{g \in G} = \left( \sum_{h \in G} b_{h} \delta_{h, g} \right)_{g \in G}
		 = \left( b_{g} \right) _{g \in G}.\] 
		This means that \[
		a\cdot y = \left( \sum_{h \in G} a_h b_{h^{-1}g} \right)_{g \in G} = \left( \delta_{g, 1} \right) _{g \in G} 
	.\] 
	In other words
	\[
	\sum_{h \in G} a_h b_{h^{-1}g} = \delta_{g, 1}
	.\]
	But this means exactly that $ab = 1$. So  $a$ is right invertible as well. 
	\end{proof}	
	
	\section{Conclusion}

We shall now briefly discuss the content and results of this report and how they contribute to our attempt to thoroughly examine Kaplansky’s direct finiteness conjecture and gain insight in how it relates to the notion of sofic groups.


Firstly, we extensively explored the definition and properties of sofic groups as well as closely related concepts. In particular, we investigated the amenability and residual finiteness of groups and their meaning in the context of this subject. In both cases, we ended our analysis with a proof of their implying soficity. 


Secondly, we have drawn the connection between sofic groups and Kaplansky’s conjecture via the notion of surjunctivity. Specifically, we have provided proof of both the implication $amenable \Rightarrow surjunctive$ as well as $sofic \Rightarrow surjunctive$ for any countable group using independent approaches respectively. More importantly, however, the core of the report closes with proof that surjunctive groups adhere to Kaplansky’s conjecture in the case of finite fields. 


Finally, we can now conclude this report with the issue of open problems which remain in this area of mathematical research. In discussing this subject, we have quite naturally come across Gottschalk’s conjecture, as it tightly links the question of general surjunctivity with Kaplansky’s conjecture. Namely, if every countable group could be shown to be surjunctive, this would immediately resolve Kaplansky’s conjecture for finite fields. Even more striking, however, is the idea that every group might be sofic as well, as there exist no known counterexamples – though Weiss does not seem particularly enthusiastic about this possibility \cite[introduction]{weiss_2000} -  . Soficity for all countable groups would settle the question of direct finiteness of their group rings over any field.

	\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\numberline{B} A Brief Introduction to Free Groups} 

This section is a brief introduction to the free groups, as many of our readers may not be familiar with this family of groups. 
This is in no way meant to be a rigorous construction of the group and its properties, rather it is an informal overview of its construction and its most important property.
The details can be found in many algebra text books such as \cite[section 7.9]{artin_algebra_1991} or \cite[section 5.5]{rotman_advanced_2015}.

The construction of a free group starts with the notion of an \emph{alphabet}, which is a set of \emph{letters}/symbols. We usually denote the alphabet with $S$. In the case where the alphabet only contains two letters we usually denote these with  $a,b$. In other cases we usually index the letters $x_i$ for some index $i \in I$, such that  $S = \{x_i  \mid i \in I\} $.

Using the letters of the alphabet  $S = \{x_i \mid i \in I\} $ we can make \emph{words}. Words are finite sequences of letters and inverses of letters. At this point inverses of letters are just more symbols. We denote $W(S)$ for the words made with letters in $S$. For example if $S = \{a,b\} $ the following are words $a$, $b$, $a^{-1}$, $ab^{-1}$, $aa^{-1}b$, $aabba^{-1}$, $1$. Notice that there is also the empty word containing no letters (denoted by $1$). 
We define the \emph{reduction of a word}, $\red w$,  as the operation that repeatedly scraps any pairs of letters adjacent to its inverse, $x_ix_i^{-1}$ and $x_i^{-1}x_i$, until there are no more such pairs. 
For example $\red({a^{-1}ab}) = b$, $\red(a a^{-1}) =1$ $\red(aba^{-1}b^{-1}) = aba^{-1}b^{-1}$, $\red(a^{-1}bb^{-1}a^{-1}) = 1$, $\red(x_1x_2x_3) = x_1x_2x_3$.

We can define a \emph{multiplication} on words by concatenating the sequences and reducing the result. For example $(ab)\cdot (ba) = abba$, $(ab)\cdot(b^{-1}a) = \red(abb^{-1}a) = aa$.
Using this multiplication it turns out that we can define the \emph{free group generated by $S$} as  \[
	F_S = \{\text{reduced words in $W(S)$}\}, \cdot  
.\]
We also write $F_S = \left<S \right>$, or in the case $S = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} $, we write $F_S = \left<x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \right>$. If  $S$ is finite with  $n = \card{S}$, we also write  $F_n$ as for two alphabets of the same cardinality  $S, S'$ the groups $F_S$ and $F_{S'}$ are isomorphic.


In some sense, the free group, $F_S$ is the largest group that can be generated by the elements of $S$. This is formalized in the following \emph{universal property of the free group}, that characterizes the free group. 
\begin{property}[{\cite[ch. 5, p. 298]{rotman_advanced_2015}}]
	If  $S$ is a subset of a group  $F$, then $F$ is the free group generated by $S$ if and only if for every group $G$ and function $f:S \to G$ there exists a unique morphism $\phi:F \to G$ such that $\phi(s) = f(s)$ for all $s \in S$.
	I.e. such that $\phi$ makes the following diagram commute:
	\[	
	\begin{tikzcd}
		F \arrow[rd, "\phi"]  \\
		S \arrow[u, hook] \arrow[r, "f"] & G
	\end{tikzcd}
\]

\end{property}
